# Personal projects and learning

## â˜• Projects

I have been working on creating a repo of advanced data structures and algorithms in Java. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/71xn/algorithmsDataStructures).

I have recently started working on a small side project, creating a [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) solver. That will eventually be available online. The blog post and source code can be found [here](https://finnlestrange.tech/programming/WordleSolver/).

## ðŸ“š Learning

### Project Euler Solutions

My Java solutions for the [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/archives) problems and challenges can be found [here](https://github.com/71xn/projecteuler-solutions).

### Courses

I am about to continue working on the Machine Learning w/ Python & TensorFlow course from freecodecamp.
