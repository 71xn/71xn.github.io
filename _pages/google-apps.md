This is just a short guide on my setup for developing [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Tools
Here is just a simple list with download links to all the things I use:

 * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
 * [Volta](https://volta.sh/) - For Node JS version management 
 * [Clasp](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp)
 * [Google Apps Script Node Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/google-apps-script) - For Syntax Highlighting and Autocomplete
