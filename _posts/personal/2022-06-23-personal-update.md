excerpt: ðŸŽ“ A short life & project update.

> Just a short personal projects & general life update now that summer has started and I am much more active again.

### ðŸ“’ Personal Life
Now that I am finished exams and school, I'm just waiting to find out what uni I'll end up going to. I am currently employed as an IT Assistant in the education sector, working on organizing and writing custom modules for a student information system. I have also been spending much more time working on learning new skill and putting hours into my personal projects. 

### ðŸ¦º Projects
I have been working a lot more on projects now and learning more skills. I am still working on building a custom `Pomodoro Timer` and a custom VPN service provider that makes use of a transparent proxy to route all traffic, `ssl` & `openvpn` through port `HTTPS 443`. Making it much harder to block on most firewalls without employing deep packet inspection. I am also looking to learn more about electronics, circuit design, prototyping and pcb design / manufacture, with the eventual hope of creating a custom `usb-c` macro pad with 6 keys and 2 rotary encoders.
